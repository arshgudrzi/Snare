# Snare
Snare is a versatile red teaming tool for wireless network analysis and attacks. It allows you to capture packets, decrypt traffic, and execute Deauthentication attacks, simulating real-world threats. With its stealthy operations, Snare helps cybersecurity professionals assess network security and test vulnerabilities undetected.
Snare - A Red Teaming and Penetration Testing Tool
Description

Snare is a powerful red teaming tool designed to assist in wireless network analysis and penetration testing. This tool was created to manually sniff network traffic and identify open ports on routers that prohibit traditional network port scans. Often used in penetration testing and educational environments, Snare provides a unique way to analyze and test Wi-Fi networks under various security conditions.

The project is currently a work in progress, with future updates aimed at enhancing functionality and improving user experience. I welcome contributions and help from the community to take this tool to the next level.

Please note that this project is for educational purposes only. While I fully intend for this tool to be used for ethical penetration testing and security assessments, I acknowledge that malicious actors may still utilize it. Many of these actors take courses and learn from materials intended to secure the digital world, only to misuse that knowledge for hacking and breaching networks. I accept the risk of this tool being used for malicious purposes, but I encourage its use by ethical security professionals to enhance and secure networks. I extend my regards to all honest and ethical security engineers who strive to protect the digital space.
Features

    Packet Sniffing: Capture network traffic, including Wi-Fi data packets, to analyze network vulnerabilities.
    Port Scanning: Identify open ports on routers that restrict traditional network port scanning methods.
    Deauthentication Attacks: Perform targeted deauthentication attacks to test network resilience.
    Traffic Decryption: Use the provided Wi-Fi password to decrypt captured traffic and extract valuable network information.
    Network Data Extraction: Extract and analyze MAC addresses, IP addresses, and ports for further network assessment.

Requirements

Before running Snare, ensure you have the following tools and libraries installed:
Python Libraries:

    Scapy: For packet sniffing and network traffic manipulation.

To install the necessary Python library, use the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt
External Tools:

    Aircrack-ng: A suite of tools for Wi-Fi network security analysis.
    Tshark: A network protocol analyzer used for extracting data from packet captures.

To install the required tools, use your system's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run:
sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng tshark
System Requirements:

    A compatible wireless network interface card (NIC) that supports monitor mode.
    Linux-based operating system (e.g., Ubuntu, Kali Linux).

Usage

To run Snare, use the following command:
sudo python3 snare.py <interface> [deauth <target_mac> <gateway_mac>]
Parameters:

    <interface>: The network interface you want to use (e.g., wlan0).
    [deauth <target_mac> <gateway_mac>]: Optional. Performs a Deauthentication attack on the specified target and gateway.

Example:
sudo python3 snare.py wlan0 deauth 00:11:22:33:44:55 66:77:88:99:00:11
This will launch a deauthentication attack on the target device 00:11:22:33:44:55 via the gateway 66:77:88:99:00:11.
Help Section
Starting Snare:

    Set your wireless interface to monitor mode using the following command:
    sudo airmon-ng start <interface>
    Run the Snare script with your interface as the argument:
    sudo python3 snare.py <interface>
Deauthentication Attack:

    To perform a Deauthentication attack, use the deauth option followed by the target MAC address and gateway MAC address:
    sudo python3 snare.py wlan0 deauth <target_mac> <gateway_mac>
Stopping Snare:

    Press Ctrl+C to stop packet capture and other ongoing activities.
    Snare will automatically save any captured packets and network data to the specified output files.

Contributing

Snare is an open-source project, and I encourage anyone interested in contributing to fork the repository and submit pull requests for improvements. If you have suggestions for new features or fixes, feel free to open an issue, and I will consider it in future updates.
Final Notes

While this tool is intended for ethical penetration testing, I acknowledge that malicious actors may attempt to use it for unauthorized network intrusions. Many individuals who complete courses designed to secure digital systems often misuse the knowledge for unlawful activities. Despite this, I accept the risk that some may misuse this tool, as it's beyond my control. However, I encourage responsible and ethical use of Snare to safeguard digital networks and systems. My deepest regards go to the security engineers working hard to defend our digital world from malicious actors.

This tool is designed with educational and penetration testing purposes in mind, and I fully support its use to improve the security of wireless networks.
